# PocketMob

Capture mobs in spawn eggs.

## Abstract

Some potions can be turned into mob catchers. Throwing them at mobs
will attempt to capture them in an egg. There are different types of
mobs and each has its own chance of success, along with additional
restrictions. Success will cause the mob to disappear and a spawn egg
to appear instead, capturing the mob type and its NBT tag.
